# Demo stories

The demos use components from this library to illustrate pages and navigation. It is based on a scenario where a user have access to several other actors, including other people and deleted accounts.

## Inbox

The inbox demo illustrates navigation between inbox pages, selecting a dialog, switching accounts and a simple version of searching the inbox. It uses `DialogList` and `Dialog`-components.

## User profile

The user profile demo uses the `AccountList` to manage accounts, and `SettingsList` for managing alerts and settings. It also includes an activity log page based on `Timeline`.
