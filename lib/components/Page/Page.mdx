# Building pages

Build pages using `PageBase` and spesific components or general purpuse components like `Section` and `Heading` to divide and create hiearchy.

```tsx
return (
  <PageBase>
    <PageNav />
    <Heading siz="xl" />
    <Section>
      <Heading siz="lg" />
    </Section>
    <Section>
      <Heading siz="lg" />
    </Section>
  </PageBase>
);
```

## Section, List and Grid

Layout components share similar props for `color`, `size`, which is inherited to it's children.

Use `Section` to divide pages into appropriate pieces. Section can be extended using `padding` and `spacing` props.

Use `List` and `Grid` to present content in lists or grid, respectively. Both have a default `spacing`, relative to it's `size`.

If none of these works, you can use `Flex`, which is a general purpuse layout component, containing shared props and styles that are used to build more spesific components.

## Heading and Typography

Use `Heading` for headings. Use `Typography` for bodytext including paragraphs, lists, and headings.

## List pages

Pages that contains lists of objects, for example a list of accounts or users.

```tsx
return (
  <PageBase>
    <PageNav breadcrumbs />
    <Heading siz="xl" />
    <Toolbar />
    <List />
  </PageBase>
);
```
