# The Toolbar

The toolbar provides a way of navigating and filtering content. It should appear directly above the content that can be filtered.

## Building a toolbar

Toolbars can include menus, a search field and filters, or a combination of some of them:

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Composition} />

A toolbar with search and filter:

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.SearchAndFilter} />

For simple, single-option filters, like showing or hiding deleted items, a switch might be a better option than a filter:

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.SearchAndSwitch} />

## Using filters

Toolbars can include multiple filters:

### Static filters

Filters can be static, making all available filters available at once.

<Canvas of={ToolbarFilterStories.Controlled} />

### Removable filters

When using multiple filtes, consider making some or all filters removable, displaying relevant filters as they are added to the toolbar:

This type of filtering works well for faceted navigation, where available filters might change depending on what is selected.

## Combining with account selector

The Toolbar can include the AccountMenu, creating a shortcut for switching accounts. Combined with addable filters, the current account marks a starting point for faceted navigation.

## Combining with search

Filters available in the toolbar can work as post-filtering for a global search, but the Toolbar can also include a simple search that can be used for filtering content by simple queries.
