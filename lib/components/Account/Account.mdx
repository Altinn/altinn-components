# The Account

An `Account` is a representation of a person or a company. Signing in will give access to your personal account.

Depending on role and privileges granted by others, a user might have access to multiple accounts, both companies and other people.

To distinguish between different people and companies, accounts are followed by a unique `Avatar`. People accounts use light coloured circles, while companies use dark coloured squares.

## Signing in

Before signing in, the `GlobalMenuButton` will display a padlock, indicating that the user should login.

## Global menu

The `GlobalMenu` follows the current account, giving access to different parts of the application. Personal settings should allways be available, even when representing someone else.

## Switching accounts

The `AccountMenu` is used to switch between accounts. It can be accessed from the `GlobalMenu` or in context where appropriate.

In some cases, where switching accounts is a primary tasks, the accountMenu can be included in context, using the `Toolbar`.
