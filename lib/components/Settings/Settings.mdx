# Settings

Settings represents pieces of data that might be changed by the user, typically via a modal or a new page.

## SettingsItem

Settings without value is identified by a title. Use a text badge to indicate action.

<Canvas of={SettingsItemStories.Default} />

Adding a value pushes the title up, focusing on the data. Badge can be used to summarize:

<Canvas of={SettingsItemStories.Value} />

## SettingsList

Use `SettingsList` to create a list of settings panels.

<Canvas of={SettingsListStories.Default} />

## Grouped, searchable settings

`SettingsList` combined with a `Toolbar` to make it searchable.

<Canvas of={SettingsListStories.AlertSettings} />

## Composition

Settings are built using `SettingsItem`, `List` and `Divider`.

```tsx
return (
    <List>
      <SettingsItem />
      <Divider as="li" />
      <SettingsItem />
      <Divider as="li">
      <SettingsItem />
    </List>
);
```
