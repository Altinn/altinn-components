# Anatomy of a dialog

A full dialog is built up of a header and a body, and depending on the content of the dialog, potentially a history part and a list of transmissions. Metadata is split and presented in relation to different parts of the dialog.

## DialogHeader

The header introduces the dialog with a `title` and an optional a `status` and due date.

## DialogBody

The body is the main part of a dialog, including the `summary` potential `attachments` and/or one or more calls to `actions`. Content is introduced with a timestamp and highlighted with a border, pointing from the senders avatar, indicating the origin of the content and that it could be part of a timeline.

## DialogHistory

The history is a curated list of activities and/or transmissions that has happened in the past, informing the user of important events that has led to the current state of the dialog.

## Putting it together

A dialog page is made up by the header, body, tabs and a tabpanel.
