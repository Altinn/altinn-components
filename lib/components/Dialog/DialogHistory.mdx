# Dialog history and logs

A dialog can include logs of activities and transmissions representing events that have happened in the past.

By default, the history should display a curated list of transmissions and/or activities. If the dialog contains lots of activities or transmissions, the history should be collapsed by default.

The activity log is a list of every activity related to the dialog, ordered by time.
