# DialogBody

Dialog body represents the main part of a dialog. It is made up three parts;

1. A header with `sender` and `recipient` and the sender's logo or avatar.
2. The content part which should contain a `summary` pointing to optional `attachments` and/or `actions`.
3. A footer indicating who have seen the dialog, exposing a `SeenByLog` on interaction.
