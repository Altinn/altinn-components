# Button and ButtonGroup

Use Buttons to initialize actions. The label should indicate what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

## Differences from Designsystemet

The Button-component is built upon the Button-component from Designsystemet. Key differences:

- The `asChild` prop is replaced with an `as` prop.
- The `data-size` prop is replaced with a `size` prop.
- The `data-variant` prop is replaced with an `variant` prop.
- Altinn uses descriptive variants (solid, tinted, outline, ghost).
- Altinn introduces a `rounded` prop to make buttons circular.
- Altinn introduces a `ButtonGroup` component to group buttons.

## Colors

Buttons can be colored with the `color` prop.

## Sizes

Sizes range from xs to lg. Md is the default size.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Sizes} />

## Variants

While Designsystemet uses variants according to importance (primary, secondary, tertiary), Altinn uses descriptive variants.

## Using icons

Buttons can be used with icons. Use `icon=true` for a slightly larger icon.

## Combining buttons with ButtonGroup

Use `ButtonGroup` with a `size` prop to combine buttons with normalized spacing. The `size` prop is inherited to the children.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Default} />

Add `connected=true` to remove spacing.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Connected} />

Use `ButtonGroupDivider` to divide connected buttons.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.WithDivider} />

Use ButtonGroup to create ComboButtons:

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.ComboButton} />

## Toolbars

Create toolbars by combining ButtonGroup, Inputs and different Button variants.
