# The searchbar

The layout includes a prominent search that should handle search behavior across products.

Until we are able to provide a global search across all products, the search will start out as a local search in context of each product.

## Search context and scopes

The placeholder text of the search should reflect the context of the product. Before login the placeholder should reflect what content is searchable:

<Canvas of={Searchbar.GlobalSearch} />

In other contexts, like the Inbox, the placeholder should indicate that search will operate within that context.

<Canvas of={Searchbar.InboxSearch} />

To enable users to search across products, we can use scopes to provide an option to trigger the same query in a different context.

<Canvas of={Searchbar.InboxScopesExpanded} />

## Using suggestions

Based on the query, the autocomplete can be used to suggest relevant searches, for example applying a filter for sender if the query matches a sender's name.

**Note**: Indicating number of hits is a nice feature, but not required in first version; this requires a backend that explicitly can provide this information and/or requires searches in parallel.

Autocomplete can also be used to suggest top hits:
