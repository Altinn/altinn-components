# Using forms and form fields

Altinn form fields are based on components from Designsystemet and can be used as is or mixed with Ds components.

## Differences from Designsystemet

While Designsystemet uses the `data-` attributes for color and size, Altinn components use `size` and `color` props.

### Sizes

While `md` is the default size, mose cases should use the `sm` size. Altinn also introduces an smaller `xs` size, to be used in toolbars and in other cases where space is limited.
